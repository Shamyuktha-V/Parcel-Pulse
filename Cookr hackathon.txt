Cookr hackathon

problem statement 2

input:

	riders count = n [name list] 

	csv:
		customers	kitchens[names]		customer_location(coorinates)	kitchen_location(coordinates)	order_time	ready_time	


Output:
	json:
		customers - key
		ridername - value		
 
Process:

kd tree for customers
kd tree for kitchens

for 1km distance --- calculate the distance using coordinates

for on the way ---- check whether both lies on same side of the root and there is a path between them

for 10 mins - subtract the ready time of the products

for rider reaching time ---- same speed for all riders ( if we done this optimize it with different speed)
